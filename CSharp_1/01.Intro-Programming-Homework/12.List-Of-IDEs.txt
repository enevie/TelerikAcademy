01."Anjuta" :
	Anjuta is an integrated development environment written for the GNOME project.
	It has support for the C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and Vala programming languages. 
	It comes standard on base installation DVDs of major Linux distributions 
	such as Ubuntu, openSUSE, Fedora, and Mandriva Linux (amongst others).



02."Dev-C++":
	Dev-C++ is a free integrated development environment (IDE) 
	distributed under the GNU General Public License for programming in C and C++. 
	MinGW, a free compiler, is bundled with it. The IDE is written in Delphi.
	The project is hosted by SourceForge. 
	Dev-C++ was originally developed by programmer Colin Laplace. 
	Dev-C++ runs exclusively on Microsoft Windows.



03."MonoDevelop":
	MonoDevelop is an open source integrated development environment for Linux, 
	OS X, and Windows. 
	Its primary focus is development of projects that use Mono and .NET frameworks. 
	MonoDevelop integrates features similar to those of NetBeans and 
	Microsoft Visual Studio, such as automatic code completion, source control, 
	a graphical user interface (GUI) and Web designer. 
	MonoDevelop integrates a Gtk# GUI designer called Stetic. 
	It supports Boo, C, C++, C#, CIL, D, F#, Java, Oxygene, Python, Vala,
	 and Visual Basic.NET.



04."SharpDevelop":
	SharpDevelop (also styled as #develop) is a free and open source integrated 
	development environment (IDE) for the .NET Framework, Mono, Gtk# and Glade# platforms.
	It supports development in C#, Visual Basic .NET, Boo, F#, IronPython 
	and IronRuby programming languages.



05."C++Builder":
	C++Builder is a rapid application development (RAD) environment, 
	originally developed by Borland and as of 2009 owned by Embarcadero Technologies, 
	for writing programs in the C++ programming language targeting Windows and OS X. 
	C++Builder combines the Visual Component Library and IDE written in Delphi with a 
	C++ compiler. 
	Most components developed in Delphi can be used in C++Builder with no 
	or little modification, although the reverse is not true.
	C++Builder includes tools that allow drag-and-drop visual development, 
	making programming easier by incorporating a WYSIWYG 
	graphical user interface builder.
